# Hill Climbing Decryptor

A decryptor using hill-climbing algorithm for simple resititution cipher and Vigen√®re cipher.

Hill-Climbing:
  1. get current score of the current key.
  2. try each posible key change and record each score.
  3. if there is a score higher than current score, change current key to the corresponding new key.
     else output the current key and end the program.
